During the submit in single page app, the data is still sent to the server and hence 1 HTTP request is present, after which the JS file stats to not do what is default, which is to reload the page, and just sends back the notes along with the new note which the browser would then render on its own, hence there are only 1 HTTP requests and so it saves time.
